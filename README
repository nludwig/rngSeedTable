RngSeedTable makes it easy to get random seeds
for your python codes that need RNG seeds. It
makes and manages a set of files in the current
directory that contain a list of randomly generated
seeds.

Also included in this directory is an implementation
of the pcg RNG, which is used by RngSeedTable to
create the RNG seeds.

main() in RngSeedTable has an example on how
to use the method getSeed(n) to get n random
seeds from the tables in the current directory
(and the create or update these tables as necessary).
